This is just a git repository to put my custom chrome plugins.

ww-novel-ext contains scripts that automatically remove sidebar and increase font-size of some novel website where I read chinese/japanese/korean novels.
wuwiaworld.com, novelplanet.com and m.wuwiaworld.co are the only one for now.
There is high probability of getting some errors, especially on pages differents than the chapters.
